<p>All females aged 9 - 26 are strongly recommended to get the HPV vaccination
to prevent cervical cancer.</p>
<p>Even if you have received the HPV vaccination, it is important that you
still go for regular cervical cancer screening as the HPV vaccination only
protects against 70 to 90 per cent of high-risk HPV types.</p>
<p>Go for regular cervical cancer screening as it is the most effective way
to detect high-risk HPV types that can cause cervical cancer. All women
aged 25 and above who have ever had sex should have either a Pap test once
every three years (for women 25 to 29 years old) or an HPV (or HPV DNA)
test once every five years (for women 30 years and above).</p>
