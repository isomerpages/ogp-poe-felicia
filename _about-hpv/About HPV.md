<h4>What is HPV?</h4>
<p>HPV stands for Human Papillomavirus, a common virus that can infect many
parts of the body in both males and females.</p>
<p>There are more than 100 different types of HPV, grouped into (i) high-risk
types (may cause cancer) and (ii) low-risk types (non-cancer causing).</p>
<p>About 40 HPV types can infect the genital area.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>High-risk types of HPV are associated with cervical, vaginal and vulvar
cancer in women, and less commonly, anal or penile cancer in men. The most
common high-risk types are HPB subtypes 16 and 18.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low-risk types of HPV may cause no symptoms or lead to genital warts.
HPV types 6 and 11 are responsible for about 90% of genital warts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other HPV types may infect the skin of the fingers, hands, mouth, throat
and face.</p>
<h4>How is HPV transmitted?</h4>
<p>HPV infection is very common in men and women.</p>
<p>It can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact such as sexual activity
(including oral sex), by sharing contaminated sex toys and very rarely,
during delivery from an infected mother to her baby. HPV cannot be spread
by sitting on toilet seats or touching common surfaces.</p>
