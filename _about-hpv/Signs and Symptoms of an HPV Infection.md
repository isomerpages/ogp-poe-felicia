<h4>What are the signs and symptoms of an HPV Infection?</h4>
<p>Most HPV infections do not have any signs or symptoms. Some HPV infections
may cause genital warts, but they can also cause oral HPV infections such
as warts in the mouth or throat or oropharyngeal cancers.</p>
<p>High-risk HPV infection of the cervix does not cause any signs or symptoms.
The abnormality on the cervix is detectable by cervical screening (Pap
test) and by HPV DNA (genetic material) tests.</p>
<p>Symptoms of cervical cancer include abnormal vaginal bleeding such as
bleeding after menstrual periods or after sex. There may also be changes
in the amount, colour or smell of the vaginal discharge.</p>
