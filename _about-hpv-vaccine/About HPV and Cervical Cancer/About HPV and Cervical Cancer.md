<p><strong>About HPV</strong>
</p>
<p>HPV stands for Human Papillomavirus, a common virus that can infect many
parts of the body in both males and females.</p>
<p>There are more than 100 different types of HPV, grouped into (i) high-risk
types (may cause cancer) and (ii) low-risk types (non-cancer causing)</p>
<p><strong>How is HPV related to Cervical Cancer?</strong>
</p>
<p>Certain types of HPV can infect the cervix (the lower part of the womb),
vagina and vulva. In most cases, the body's immune system can fight off
the infection and clear the virus.</p>
<p>However, the HPV infection can persist sometimes and cause abnormal changes
to the cells. Some of these abnormal cells may develop into cervical cancer.
This usually takes years to develop but is one of the most significant
impacts of being infected with HPV.</p>
<p>Specifically, HPV subtypes 16 and 18 account for about 70 per cent of
cervical cancer cases.</p>
