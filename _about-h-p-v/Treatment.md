<h4>Can HPV be treated?</h4>
<p>No treatment is required for asymptomatic HPV infections. Most HPV infections
(90 percent of the cases) are cleared by the body without the need for
treatment.</p>
<p>Treatment is directed at HPV-associated conditions such as pre-cancerous
lesions, cancer or genital warts.</p>
<p>Although the HPV virus cannot be treated, regular cervical cancer screening
tests can either help to detect changes in the cervical cells caused by
HPV infection (Pap test) or to identify high-risk HPV cancer-causing types.</p>
