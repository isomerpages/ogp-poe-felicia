<h4>Cost and Subsidies</h4>
<p>Female Singapore Citizens (SCs) and Permanent Residents (PRs) who fall
within the recommended age group for HPV vaccination (i.e. from 18th birthday
to before 27th birthday) will be able to enjoy subsidies and use MediSave
for Cervarix. The HPV vaccine eligible for a subsidy and MediSave use was
selected while taking into consideration factors such as the local disease
burden, vaccine safety, clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the
vaccines.</p>
<p>Please refer to the table below on the subsidies available and MediSave
use.</p>

<p>Eligible SCs will be able to enjoy subsidies at CHAS GP clinics and polyclinics,
while eligible PRs will be able to enjoy subsidies at polyclinics only.</p>
<p>At CHAS GP clinics, eligible SCs can expect to pay no more than $45 per

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Orange and Blue CHAS Card holders: The maximum amount to be paid for HPV2
vaccination is $23 per dose.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Green and non-CHAS card holders: The maximum amount to be paid for HPV2

of MediSave.</p>
