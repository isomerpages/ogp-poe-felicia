account for 70% of all cervical cancers, and have been shown to be both
clinically- and cost-effective in the local setting. It is registered for
use for females. HPV9 vaccination (Gardasil 9) provides protection against
an additional 20% of cancer-causing HPV types. It is registered for use
for both females and males.</p>
