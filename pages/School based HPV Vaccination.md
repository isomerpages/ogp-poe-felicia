<p>Females attending MOE-registered secondary schools, Special Education
(SPED) schools, Privately-Funded schools and full-time Madrasahs will be
offered HPV2 in Secondary 1 and 2. This programme has been in place since
2019. Secondary One students who missed the school-based HPV vaccination
will be contacted by HPB vendors and offered the option to complete their
vaccination in the vendor’s clinic.</p>
