<p><strong>Understanding HPV Vaccination and Dosages</strong>
<br>It is recommended that HPV vaccination be completed as early as possible
between the ages of 9 – 26 years old.</p>
<p>For females aged 9 – 14 years at the time of the first dose, a total of
2 doses are recommended. The second dose may be given 5 to 13 months after
the first dose.</p>
<p>For females aged 15 years and above at the time of the first dose, a total
of 3 doses are recommended. The second dose may be given between 1 to 2.5
months after the first dose, followed by the third dose between 5 to 12
months after the first dose.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing type of HPV Vaccine</strong>
</p>
<p>HPV2 (Cervarix) provides protection against HPV types 16 and 18, which
account for 70% of all cervical cancers, and have been shown to be both
clinically- and cost-effective in the local setting. It is registered for
use for females. HPV9 vaccination (Gardasil 9) provides protection against
an additional 20% of cancer-causing HPV types. It is registered for use
for both females and males. <strong>Government subsidies and MediSave are not available for vaccination with HPV9 (Gardasil 9) but you have the option to take this vaccination at your own cost. Please check with the clinic directly on the pricing</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have taken one type of HPV vaccine for the first dose and wish
to change to the other type of HPV vaccine for the second dose, it is generally
fine to do so.</p>
<p>Please confirm with your doctor on the type of HPV vaccination that you
wish to receive prior when making the appointment.</p>
<p><strong>HPV Vaccination provided in Secondary Schools</strong>
</p>
<p>Females attending MOE-registered secondary schools, Special Education
(SPED) schools, Privately-Funded schools and full-time Madrasahs will be
offered HPV2 in Secondary 1 and 2. This programme has been in place since
2019. Secondary One students who missed the school-based HPV vaccination
will be contacted by HPB vendors and offered the option to complete their
vaccination in the vendor’s clinic.</p>

or who study in private institutions or overseas, there are several options
available to help them complete their HPV vaccinations:</p>
