<p>HPV vaccines help to prevent infection with Human Papillomavirus (HPV),
which may lead to cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancer in women, or anal
cancer and genital warts in both women and men.</p>
<p>HPV infection spreads from one person to another through skin-to-skin
contact such as during sexual activity, or less frequently during delivery
from an infected mother to her baby.</p>
<p>Most HPV infections, including the strains that can cause cervical cancer,
do not have any signs or symptoms. Symptoms of cervical cancer may include
abnormal vaginal bleeding such as bleeding after menstrual periods or after
sex. There may also be changes in the amount, colour or smell of vaginal
discharge. It is recommended to have regular screening, e.g. Pap smear
to detect cervical cancer early.</p>
