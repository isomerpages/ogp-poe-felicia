<p>HPV2 (Cervarix) provides protection against HPV types 16 and 18, which
account for 70% of all cervical cancers, and have been shown to be both
clinically- and cost-effective in the local setting. It is registered for
use for females. HPV9 vaccination (Gardasil 9) provides protection against
an additional 20% of cancer-causing HPV types. It is registered for use
for both females and males. <strong>Government subsidies and MediSave are not available for vaccination with HPV9 (Gardasil 9) but you have the option to take this vaccination at your own cost. Please check with the clinic directly on the pricing</strong>.</p>
