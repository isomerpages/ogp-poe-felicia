<h4>How is HPV related to Cervical Cancer?</h4>
<p>Certain types of HPV can infect the cervix (the lower part of the womb),
vagina and vulva. In most cases, the body's immune system can fight off
the infection and clear the virus.</p>
<p>However, the HPV infection can persist sometimes and cause abnormal changes
to the cells. Some of these abnormal cells may develop into cervical cancer.
This usually takes years to develop but is one of the most significant
impacts of being infected with HPV.</p>
<p>Specifically, HPV subtypes 16 and 18 account for about 70 per cent of
cervical cancer cases.</p>
<h4>What are the risk factors for Cervical Cancer?</h4>
<p>Risk factors for the development of cervical cancer include the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>HPV subtypes - Persistent infection with high-risk types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immune status - People who are immunocompromised, such as those living
with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), are more likely to have persistent
HPV infections and a more rapid progression to pre-cancer and cancer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Co-infection with other sexually transmitted agents, such as those that
cause herpes, simplex, chlamydia and gonorrhoea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple sexual partners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The onset of sexual intercourse at an early age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tobacco smoking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
